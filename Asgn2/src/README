a. Brian Nguyen and Charles Snead
b. The following commands may be necessary to run the nums, snakes, and hungry programs:

export MY_VARIABLE=~pn-cs453/Given/Asgn2/lib64/
export MY_VARIABLE=~pn-cs453/Given/Asgn2/lib64/lib
export MY_VARIABLE=~pn-cs453/Given/Asgn2/lib64/libsnakes.so
LDLD_LIBRARY_PATH=~pn-cs453/Given/Asgn2/lib64/
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~pn-cs453/Given/Asgn2/lib64/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

After running "make" all programs should be able to run with "./nums", "./snakes", "./hungry"

c. Program works properly
d. Nothing else to consider
